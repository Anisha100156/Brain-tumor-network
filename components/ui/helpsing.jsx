          A brain tumor is an abnormal growth of cells within the brain or its surrounding structures. These tumors can be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous), and they vary widely in their growth rates and effects on brain function. Brain tumors may originate in the brain itself (primary tumors) or spread from other parts of the body (secondary or metastatic tumors). The impact of a brain tumor depends on its size, type, and location, as even a benign tumor can be life-threatening if it compresses vital brain structures. Diagnosis and treatment typically involve imaging studies such as MRI or CT scans, followed by biopsy and a combination of surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy based on the type of tumor.
